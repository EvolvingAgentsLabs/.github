# Evolving Agents Labs

## About Our Research

A year ago, the idea of describing a workflow once to an AI and having a 2GB local model execute it daily with actual reasoning seemed like science fiction. So did generating production mobile apps with on-device AI in minutes, or having workflows that improve themselves with each execution.

We built it. We call it **LLMunix**.

We explore early-stage concepts in adaptive AI through experimental frameworks and research prototypes. Our work investigates how intelligent agents might adapt, learn, and evolve—not in the cloud adapting to everyone, but locally and privately, adapting to you.

**All projects remain permanently in alpha status as ongoing research experiments.**

## 💭 The Vision: What If...

**What if you could describe any mobile app** — "personal trainer that adapts," "study assistant that quizzes me" — and get a working prototype with on-device AI in minutes, not months?

**What if every workflow you do more than once** becomes an agent that improves each time, learning from experience and evolving its approach?

**What if AI ran locally, privately, adapting to you** — not in the cloud adapting to everyone, but on your device with your data?

These are the questions driving our research. LLMunix is our experimental answer.

## 🧪 Current Experiments

### [LLMunix](https://github.com/EvolvingAgentsLabs/llmunix) 🦄 `ALPHA`
**Pure Markdown Operating System**

A revolutionary Pure Markdown Operating System designed to be run by multiple AI runtime engines. Compatible with Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and Qwen Code.

**The Core Innovation:**
- **Define once with Claude** ($0.50): Create agent definitions with full reasoning capabilities
- **Execute infinitely with Granite** ($0): Local 2GB model executes the definition with actual reasoning
- **Cost savings**: $730/year → $0.50/year for the same flexible behavior

**Key Capabilities:**
- Multi-tier memory system with short-term and long-term learning
- Dynamic agent creation during execution
- Sentient state architecture with behavioral adaptation
- Optional mobile app generation (React Native with on-device LLMs)
- Runtime engines interpret manifest files into functional operating systems

### [LLMunix Starter](https://github.com/EvolvingAgentsLabs/llmunix-starter) 🏭 `ALPHA`
**Pure Markdown OS Template for Claude Code Web**

A fresh LLMunix template optimized for Claude Code on the web. The factory for building specialized agents dynamically—not pre-built solutions, just the essential kernel.

**Philosophy: The Factory, Not the Products**
- Traditional AI systems pre-define hundreds of agents for specific domains
- LLMunix Starter ships only 3 core system agents
- Creates exactly the agents you need, tailored to your specific problem
- Every project learns and improves future executions

**What You Get:**
- Essential kernel only (SystemAgent, MemoryAnalysisAgent, MemoryConsolidationAgent)
- Dynamic agent factory that creates specialized agents on demand
- Continuous learning from every execution
- Works with public and private repositories

**Use Cases:**
- Give Claude any ambitious goal
- System analyzes and creates specialized agents (VisionaryAgent, MathematicianAgent, etc.)
- Agents collaborate, produce outputs, log learnings
- Future projects bootstrap faster using past patterns

### [LLMunix Marketplace](https://github.com/EvolvingAgentsLabs/llmunix-marketplace) 🔌 `ALPHA`
**Claude Code CLI Plugin**

The LLMunix kernel as a Claude Code CLI plugin. Install the Pure Markdown Operating System via the marketplace and solve complex goals with a single command.

**The `/llmunix` Command:**
```bash
/llmunix "Create a biomedical quantum computing research project"
```

**What Happens:**
1. Analyzes goal and identifies required expertise
2. Creates project structure with dedicated workspace
3. **Dynamically writes new agent markdown files** for each expertise
4. Orchestrates agent collaboration via Task tool
5. Produces outputs in project directory
6. Consolidates learnings to long-term memory
7. Future projects query and reuse successful patterns

**Installation:**
```bash
/plugin marketplace add evolving-agents-labs/llmunix-marketplace
/plugin install llmunix-plugin
/llmunix "your goal here"
```

**Core Innovation:** Instead of shipping hundreds of pre-built agents, LLMunix creates the exact agent you need with a system prompt tailored to your specific problem. A biomedical quantum computing project gets VisionaryAgent, MathematicianAgent, QuantumEngineerAgent. A web scraper gets DataExtractorAgent, ParserAgent, ValidationAgent. Exactly what you need, nothing more.

## 📢 Project Evolution: From EAT to LLMunix

### Original Evolving Agents Toolkit (EAT) - Sunset Notice

The original [Evolving Agents Toolkit (EAT) Python project](https://github.com/matiasmolinas/evolving-agents) was officially discontinued in July 2025. While EAT demonstrated powerful concepts in multi-agent orchestration with MongoDB backend, we recognized the complex Python architecture was over-engineered for achieving adaptive agent behavior.

**Key insights that led to LLMunix:**
- Complex multi-component architectures created unnecessary overhead
- The core concept of autonomous agent evolution was sound
- Simpler approaches could achieve the same adaptive behaviors
- LLM capabilities alone could handle orchestration and evolution

### The Simplification

**From EAT's complexity to LLMunix's simplicity:**
- **EAT**: Multi-component Python architecture with MongoDB backend
- **LLMunix**: Pure markdown definitions interpreted by LLM runtime engines
- **Result**: Same adaptive capabilities, 10x simpler implementation

### Validation & Next Frontier

With Claude Code's implementation of **sub-agents in markdown as an official feature**, our original markdown-based agent concept has been validated by the industry. This proves the approach works.

**Our continuing research direction:**
- **LLMunix continues** as our core research platform for markdown-based agent systems
- **Three distribution methods**: Main project, Starter template, CLI plugin
- **Focus areas**: Dynamic agent creation, continuous learning, local execution
- **Next frontier**: Exploring pure LLM-native agent architectures

This represents the natural evolution: external frameworks → markdown specifications → LLM-native agents.

## 🔬 Research Areas

| Focus Area | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Adaptive Behavior Research** | How agents modify decision-making based on context, user sentiment, and interaction patterns |
| **Pure Markdown Architecture** | Using markdown as a complete operating system specification with clean separation of behavior, state, and execution |
| **Dynamic Agent Creation** | On-demand generation of specialized agents tailored to specific problem requirements |
| **Continuous Learning Systems** | Memory architectures enabling agents to improve through experience and pattern recognition |
| **Local-First AI Execution** | Running AI privately on-device with local models, maintaining privacy and zero marginal cost |
| **Learner-Follower Pattern** | Expensive LLMs create definitions once, edge models execute infinitely at zero cost |

## ⚠️ Experimental Nature

**Important**: All our projects are research prototypes exploring early-stage concepts. They should be treated as experimental research material rather than production-ready systems.

**Current Limitations:**
- Edge models are 10-20% less accurate than Claude
- Mobile apps with LLMs are 600MB-1.5GB
- Novel tasks still require expensive LLMs
- The markdown abstraction might hit limits we haven't found

**But it's working well enough to be interesting.**

We believe in transparent, open research that advances the field through shared exploration. That's why we're sharing early and asking: Where does this break? What are we not seeing?
